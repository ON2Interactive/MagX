            <p>
              Welcome to DarkroomX! By accessing or using our website and services, you agree to be bound by these Terms
              of Use. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, please do not use the service.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Overview</h2>
            <p>
              DarkroomX is an AI-powered photo editing platform that allows users to upload images and generate edits
              through natural language input. By using the platform, you agree to use it responsibly and in accordance
              with applicable laws.
            </p>

            <h2>2. User Conduct</h2>
            <p>You agree not to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Upload or generate content that is unlawful, harmful, offensive, or infringes on any third-party rights.</li>
              <li>Use the platform to create misleading, deceptive, or manipulated content that could cause harm or misrepresentation.</li>
              <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer or interfere with the service or its functionality.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Account Responsibility</h2>
            <p>
              If you create an account, you are responsible for maintaining its security and for all activity that
              occurs under your login.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>
              All content generated using DarkroomX is owned by you, the user, unless otherwise stated. However, the
              DarkroomX platform, branding, and underlying technologies are owned by the company and may not be copied,
              resold, or used without permission.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Disclaimer on Image Accuracy</h2>
            <p>
              DarkroomX uses AI to generate photo edits based on natural language descriptions. While we aim to preserve
              the original elements of the uploaded image, the final results may include subtle or significant alterations,
              enhancements, or reinterpretations of visual content.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not guarantee that the edited output will exactly match the uploaded photo or the user’s intent in
              every case. By using the service, you acknowledge and accept this creative variability inherent to
              AI-powered editing.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>
              DarkroomX is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind. We are not liable for any direct, indirect,
              incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the service, including loss of data or images.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Service Availability</h2>
            <p>
              We may update, modify, or suspend features of the platform at any time without notice. We are not
              responsible for outages, delays, or service interruptions.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Termination</h2>
            <p>
              We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access to DarkroomX for any reason, including violation of
              these terms.
            </p>

            <h2>10. Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>
              We may revise these terms at any time. Continued use of the platform after changes are posted means you
              accept the revised terms.
